                    Chi Psi Cornell is non-hazing, non-pledging fraternity at Cornell. During the short period of time of new memeber education, potential new memebers will learn the history and values that are essential to becoming a brother. For example, you will learn the story of why all Chi Psi houses around the country are known as "The Lodge".
