# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is the Chi Psi Cornell chapter. Chi Psi is a social fraternity in the interfraternity council. This client meets the client rules because it is a campus organization that needs a static website.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

    Chi Psi is a fraternity whose purpose is philanthropy and brotherhood. It is focused on developing young men socially, morally, and intellectually.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

    This organization allows brothers to get financial scholarships and fellowships. It fosters strong friendships and helps brothers develop their character.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

    There is no Cornell chapter website, only the national one. The current national website is outdated and the information is difficult to find.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

    Our audience is students who could potentially be interested in joining the Chi Psi organization or Chi Psi alumni members.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    We want visitors to learn more about the fraternity, learn about upcoming events, and learn about recruitment. Alumni can also learn about alumni events such as Homecoming.

6. What are your goals for this site?
    We hope to promote Chi Psi as a positive experience for students at Cornell by showing pictures from previous events. We also want alumni to be able to connect back to their brotherhood and see what is going on currently.

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    We want to highlight Chi Psi's colors (purple and gold) and create a professional feel that is in line with the national website.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

    Our three favorite competitors are DSP (the top business frat at Cornell), PSE (another top business frat at Cornell), and the Delta Upsilon Cornell Chapter website. All of these sites are very professional, and we hope that our website can obtain a similar feel to these sites.


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

- spent first five minutes introducing oursleves
- frat
- philanthropy
- brotherhood
- strong friendships
- informed client that we are making a static website
- financial scholarships and fellowships
- no Cornell website, only national site
- current site is outdated
- audience: students interested in recruitment, alumni
- goals for visitors: learn about frat, upcoming events, and recruitment
- show positive aspects of Chi Psi by showing pictures from current events that were held
- want alumni to see what is going on currently at Chi Psi
- want website to include fraternity colors and have a professional feel
- favorite competitors: business and social frats at Cornell with nice websites (ex. DU, DSP, and PSE)


### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

Our client wants a website that will represent Chi Psi in a positive and professional light that both entices new recruits and keeps alumni up to date on the fraternity's happenings. The purpose of the site is to provide information about the fraternity and its events. Our client specifically wants information about the fraternity as a whole and its brotherhood, specific information about recruitment, and information about alumni events to appear on the website. The client wants us to mimic the look and feel of a professional fraternity's website and include imagery of the Chi Psi brothers, house, and events and use Chi Psi's national colors to make the website unique to the Cornell chapter of Chi Psi.


### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Infrom new recruits on important dates and events
- Inform alumni on important dates and events
- Showcase pictures of the fraternity and active brothers
- Provide general information about the chapter


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

We believe the scope of the website is just right because Chi Psi is a national fraternity, but we are not creating content for nationals, just the Cornell chapter. More specifically, we will likely create webpages for recruitment, alumni of the cornell chapter, events, and philantropy (TBD after card sorting our content), and showcase imagery and text from the Cornell chapter. This is just the right size because it is only about the Cornell chapter and the main events and information that pertain to the chapter.


## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

We plan to complete all user interviews before Nov 14, which is our next meeting. In the time period before our next meeting, we will ask the client to send more details about the content they want us to include, as well as specific text and photos to use. We will analyze user goals right after the interviews are done. After we have the data collected from the user interviews, we will finalize the site's content together as a team during our next meeting on Nov 14. Our next meeting will be two days before the deadline of milestone 2, so we assume there will be enough time for us to finish the work. We will be in communication until then, so that we can continue to collaborate and work on the project before our meeting. For the final milestone, we will aim to have our user testing complete by the Monday before the project is due so that we can quickly revise the website at our final team meeting.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Find events related to the frat

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Create a calendar for events
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - People interested in learning more about frats and their events have a hard time finding events online. By listing them online, more people will be able to learn about the frat and get in touch with brothers and visit the house.

Goal 2: Get more aquainted with the brothers

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Display many pictures of brothers and quotes from them.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By showcasing the brothers and their personalities, people who are interesting in learning more about the frat and the brothers to get a better feel for the frat's environment.

Goal 3: Learn about the values and social efforts of the frat

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Display the philantropic efforts of the frat and their main values which direct the frats.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Students who are interested in joining the frat are incredibly interested about learning more about the motivations behind the frat's actions. These main actions are driven by their goals and values, including charitable efforts.

Goal 4: Learn about the rush and recruitment process of the frat

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Create a page dedicated to explaining the recruitment process and how students can decide if it is right for them.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Once students are interested in joining the frat, or are still on the fence, they likely want to learn more about what goes into the rush and recruitment process. By providing users with this page, it will be transparent what goes into the process and aid students in making an educated decision.


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

Students at Cornell that are interested in joining Greek life. All of these students have the same goal with regards to visiting the website. These goals revolve around deciding which fraternity to join and answering uniform questions to make the decision for the students. We are providing the website with answers to these expected questions by addressing the audience goals we have found.


## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://www.dspcornell.com/>

    ![Narrow screenshot of DSP website](dsp-narrow.png)

    ![Wide screenshot of DSP website](dsp-wide.png)

2. <https://www.cornellpse.com/>

    ![Narrow screenshot of PSE website](pse-narrow.png)

    ![Wide screenshot of PSE website](pse-wide.png)

3. <https://cornelldu.org/>

    ![Narrow screenshot of DU website](du-narrow.png)

    ![Wide screenshot of DU website](du-wide.png)


### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The DSP website was one of the inspiration websites provided to us by the client; DSP is a well known business fraternity at Cornell. Their website is not responsive and is designed for wide screens only. They utilize a navigation bar across the top of the screen that features their name, logo, and page names, which looks sleek and professional. I really like the large banner on the homepage that provides options for potential new members: a register for rush button and a request a coffee chat button. I think this is a design pattern that we could take inspiration from for our website. I also really like the image carousel on their homepage, and I think that either this or a carousel could be a great use of interactivity for the homepage. They also utilized their fraternity colors of purple and gold (which are the same colors that we will be working with) in a really elegant way, and the dark purple banners featured throughout the website look great. Overall, although this site is not responsive, it has a beautiful visual design and features effective interactivity including an image carousel and buttons that lead to relevant forms and information for potential members.


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The PSE website is the second website provided to us by our client as inspiration, and is another business fraternity at Cornell. Again, their site is not responsive and was designed for wide screens. Their site utilizes a navigation bar across the top of the screen, which is a common design pattern. They use an image of Cornell with text over it as their title banner with a large "learn more" button that directs users to a really cool interactive about page. This about page has a grid of 6 photos, each of which represent a different aspect of the fraternity i.e. brotherhood, philanthropy, etc. The photos are highlighted and text is revealed when you hover over them. Clicking on one of the photos leads you down to the part of the page that talks about that category with a smooth animation. This is a very attractive and sleek way to design an "About" page with many categories and could serve as inspiration to us when planning our website. Additionally, each page has a footer with links to recruitment and contact information, which is both a common design pattern and would lend functionality to our users. Content wise, I like how their homepage has a letter from the president, and this is something we could try to obtain from Chi Psi.


### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The DU website was the third that was suggested to us from the client, and is responsively designed. This website is a bit more complicated and has more content. They utilize a menu across the top of the screen with dropdowns that provide more options, which becomes a hamburger menu on narrow screens. This is a very common design pattern and an effective use of interactivity that we can draw from. Another cool interactive feature they use is a carousel of news stories across the bottom of the homepage, which effectively features updates that alumni would enjoy. Since our client wants us to feature information for alumni, this might be something for us to consider. They also utilize an image carousel at the top of the homepage, similar to DSP. Another interactive element is a form on the homepage that prompts people to sign up for their mailling list. We could include a form on our page for potential new members interested in recruitment. Visually, I think this website looks a bit outdated and the blue and yellow colors are a big loud, but the site has great functionality and is interesting to look at.


## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- General photos of Chi Psi house and brothers
- General description of the fraternity and its history for homepage
- Fraternity mission and values (can be copied with credit from Chi Psi national site)
- Description of chapter philanthropy
- Photos of "no shave november" for chapter philanthropy
- List/description of upcoming events
- Photos of current brothers
- quotes from current brothers
- recruitment information, events, and timeline



### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

Our content is directly designed to address our audience's goals of learning more about Chi Psi and its members. The audience's first goal is to learn about events related to the frat, which we will achieve by providing a list of upcoming events and details about them. The audience's second goal is to become more acquainted with the brothers so that they can asses the "vibe" of the frat. We will achieve this by including photos of brothers and gathering quotes from the brothers that reflect their personalities and what they like about Chi Psi. The third goal was to learn about the values and social efforts of the frat, which we will address by including descriptions of the fraternity's national values and Cornell-specific philanthropy efforts, along with photos of their philanthropy. Finally, the last goal is to learn about the recruitment process, which we will address by including ample information about how the recruitment process works, how to sign up, and when events start. Overall, the content on our site is targeted to appeal to an audience of potential new members so that they can learn about the fraternity and gain practical insight needed for them to decide to join.


## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

![card-sort-1](card-sort-iteration-1.jpeg)
Above is the first iteration of our card sorting. On the homepage, we have photos of the Chi Psi house and borthers, and a general descriptions of Chi Psi and its history. On the event page we only have a list of upcoming events because this is the only thing that users are expecting to see when they click on the event page. On the values page we have included a description of Chi Psi's values and missions, as well as a description of chapter philantrophy and photos of "No Shave November" because they are some featured activities that shows how much Chi Psi values philantrophy. On the brothers page we have photos of current brothers can some quotes from them to give our audience a general sense of who the brothers are and what their personality is. On the recruitment page we have the general information on Chi Psi's recruitment, such as events and timeline, as well as a section for recruitment FAQs.

![card-sort-2](card-sort-iteration-2.jpeg)
Above is the second iteration of our card sorting. The difference between the second iteration and the first one is that we moved the quotes from current brothers to the home page. We also moved the description of chapter philantrophy and photos of "No Shave November" to the events page because they can also be considered as one of the events.



### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

We decidied to use the first iteration.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

Although movinng the quotes from current brothers to the homepage can enable the audience to see the quotes as soon as they visit the website which helps them better understand Chi Psi and its vibe faster, we think it is better to put the photos of brothers and their quotes together so that the audience knows which quote is from which brother and this better helps the audience to accomplish their goal of getting more aquainted with the brothers. We also decided not to move the description of chapter philantriphy and the photos of "No Shave November" to the event page because we think they are great examples of Chi Psi's mission statement and its values, so it would be better to put them on the values page.


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- About Page
- Brothers
- Events
- Values
- Recruitment

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

These page names make sense because they clearly tell the audience what kind of content they will be able to find on the pages. They are also short and concise in order to get the information to the audience clearly and quickly.


## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

Theme 1: The first visual theme we think of is to use purple and gold because they are the theme color of Chi Psi fraternaty. Using purple and gold not only makes our website consistent with the national Chi Psi website, it's also a great way to remind the audience what the theme color of Chi Psi is, since one of their goals is to learn more about Chi Psi. Purple and gold also create great contrast, which can highlight the information we want to present and the audience can notice important information more quickly.

Theme 2: The second theme we think of is to use black and white. Black and white are even better at creating contrast, so they can also achieve what purple and gold can do in terms of presenting important information to the audience. Also, black and white can make our website look more professional, since our client want the website to have a professional feel.

Theme 3: The third theme we think of is to use purple and gold for the logo, the navigation bar, and some of the headings, and use black and white for the body of the website. This is a combination of theme 1 and 2, so it both highlights the theme color of Chi Psi and effectively presents the important information to our audience. One additional benefit of making the logo, the navigation bar, and some of the headings the theme color of Chi Psi is that they typically appear on the top of a page, which means they are usually the first thing that the audience would see. Making them the theme color of Chi Psi could remind the audience the theme color of Chi Psi most effectively, while keeping the important content in the body of the website obvious to the audience because they are in black and white.

Final Theme: We decided to use theme 3 as our final theme because of the reasons that we have stated above. It is a combination of theme 1 and theme 2 and can achieve both what theme 1 and theme 2 could do.



## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Hamburger menu: This will appear when the user views the site in mobile form, which will save space by hiding the menu, allowing the user to see more content.
- Slideshow: This will be on the home/about page and show the audience pictures of the frat house and the brothers to show the audience what this organization looks like.
- Carousel: This will be a carousel of the brothers participating in their philanthropy. This will save space, but still show the audience a lot of content to get them more engaged with the site.
- Modal: On the brothers page, there will be a modal of pictures of the current brothers, and when you click on one of their pictures, a quote will appear. This is a fun way to get direct information about the frat, from the brothers themselves, to the audience.
- Accordion: on the recruitment page, we will include a variety of FAQs. When the user clicks on one of the questions, an accordion will drop down with answers to these questions.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![First homepage sketch](home-sketch1.jpg)
For the first sketch, we used a thin navigation bar across the top with the organization's name, a large image banner with a button leading to important recruitment information, and a common design pattern of a main body and sidebar with additional information.
![First homepage sketch, narrow](home-narrow-1.jpeg)
This is a narrow version of the initial homepage sketch, utilizing the same design patterns. We no longer have a sidebar, as the screen is too narrow. We also utilize a hamburger menu instead of navigation bar because a hamburger menu is a more common design pattern for mobile.
![Second homepage sketch](home-sketch2.jpg)
For the second sketch, we changed the appearance of the header and navigation to include the organization's greek letters. We also experimented with including a carousel of photos instead of an image banner, which we think would look nice on the homepage of the website and match design expectations. We still use the design pattern of featuring a main section and a sidebar.
![Third homepage sketch](home-sketch3.jpg)
For our third sketch, we switched our image carousel to a gallery with all of the images at the side, keeping everything else the same. However, we didn't like how the gallery ended up being asymmetrical.
![Fourth homepage sketch](home-sketch4.jpg)
For our last homepage design, we centered the main image in the gallery and put thumbnails on either side of the image. Using a centered image on the homepage is more aligned with visual design principles and makes more sense for our page.
![Fourth homepage sketch, mobile](home-narrow-2.jpeg)
We liked the last homepage sketch, so we converted it to mobile. The image thumbnails for the gallery are located below the main image instead of on the sides due to the narrower screen, and we once again utilize a hamburger menu instead of navigation bar and flex-column for all content.
![Values sketch](values-sketch1.jpg)
We were inspired by our example websites for this values page. We will use divs with different background colors to feature the fraternity's mission and values, then we will use an image carousel when featuring the chapter's philanthropy. This is a visually effective way of dividing the content up into different topics, and the carousel would be a fun way to click through the different mustache pictures.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> However, you don't need to provide layout/CSS annotations.
> Please, provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow (Mobile) Design:**

![Narrow about sketch, before clicking hamburger](about-final-narrow-1.jpeg)
This is a sketch of what our narrow screen website looks like before the hamburger menu is clicked.
![Narrow about sketch, after clicking hamburger](about-final-narrow-2.jpeg)
When a user clicks on the hamburger menu, it drops down and covers the content behind it. It also makes the content a bit darker in order to help the user focus their attention strictly on the hamburger menu.
![Narrow brothers sketch, before clicking modal](brothers-final-narrow-1.jpeg)
This is a sketch of what our narrow screen website looks like before a picture of one of the brothers is clicked on.
![Narrow brothers sketch, after clicking modal](brothers-final-narrow-2.jpeg)
After a picture of a borther is clicied, a quote of theirs appears and covers the other images in the background. Similar to the hamburger menu, when the quote appears, the background is darkened to help the user focus on the quote. This design makes good use of the space, as every picture is paired with important information that comes directly from the brothers.
![Narrow events sketch](events-final-narrow.jpeg)
The events page covers both alumni and brotherhood events, which is important for students interested in the fraternity to know about. We have a good mixture of pictures and text in order to keep the user engaged despite the lack of interactivity.
![Narrow values sketch](values-final-narrow.jpeg)
Our values page contains our carousel, where users can look through images of the fraternity brothers participating in their philanthropy.


**Wide (Wide) Design:**

![Wide about sketch](about-final-wide.jpeg)
![Wide brothers sketch, before clicking modal](brothers-final-wide-1.jpeg)
we liked this layout because it show cases all of the brother's faces in a neat way. It is also similar to what the composite looks like, which is a common thing that must fraternities have. The interactivity is when you click on the picture it will pop up a blub about the brother.
![Wide brothers sketch, after clicking modal](brothers-final-wide-2.jpeg)
When the image is clicked, a modal will pop up with a description of the brother and maybe a funny quote from them. We thought this was a good use of interactivity because you can learn more about brothers of the chapter.
![Wide events sketch](events-final-wide.jpeg)
we liked the split screen layout for the events page because it showcases the two events that chi psi at cornell does, excluding recruitment which is on its own page. We chose to keep it on a seperate page becuase there events are limited to brothers only. There will be pictures of some examples of the events as well.
![Wide values sketch](values-final-wide.jpeg)
we liked this layout because it show cases the mission and values first and then it will show the current philthropy that chi psi is doing. The interactivity of the page is a carasel. We thought this was great because we have many different pictures of the brothers raising money for their chairty through growing their mustaches and showcasing it on their instagram.


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

Our design is appropriate for our audience because it fulfills all their goals that we identified earlier. The audience can find events related to the frat if they go to the event page where we list all upcoming events.The can get more aquainted with the brothers if they go to the brothers page where we have photos of all the current brothers, as well as a quote from each of them to help the audience better know what their persoanlity might be. We also addressed their goal of learning about the values and social efforts of the frat by offering a values page where we listed Chi Psi's mission statements and values, as well as photos of some featured events that illustrates them. Finally, the audience can learn about the rush and recuitment process of the frat if they go to the recruitment page where we offered them some general information about the recruitment, such as events and timeline, as well as some FAQs. Some common design patterns that we employed to increase the familiarity of the site include the navigation bar on the top of each page for wide screens, a hamburger menu to help narrow screen users navigate, image carousels, slide shows, and galleries to assist users to view images. We also make exit buttons to look like a cross so that users know how to exit certain interactivities.


## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

The interactivity we added to our website is used to make our audience's experience easier and more enjoyable. It both makes the content easier to digest, but also saves space on our site. For example, the slideshow on the home page rotates through images of the frat and its brothers, which shows the user what being in the fraternity actually looks like. While we could have just placed the pitures around the about page, by rotating through them, we are saving space and making our website more dynamic and intersting for our users. The interactivity we use also helps keep our users enaged in our site, as it allows them to actually interact with it rather than simply scrolling through the pages.


## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

Accordion:
when #FAQ clicked
    show #answers
if #FAQ clicked again
    hide #answers

Carousel:
when #arrow is clicked
