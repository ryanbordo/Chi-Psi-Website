# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    1. Divide all work evenly
    2. Show up to meetings on time
    3. Communicate
    4. Have milestone done by end of Tuesday
    5. Don't slack off on your part.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)
   1. Be on time to meetings
   2. Everyone put equal effort into your part
   3. We will communicate frequently about the work we are doing

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

   We can meet at least two days before each milestone. We can also text our group chat before we code to prevent merge conflicts.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

   We will communicate with our client via email and we can do a phone call when we need more extensive information.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    TODO: discuss and document here

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    TODO: discuss and document here

8.  What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    TODO: discuss and document here

9.  What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
